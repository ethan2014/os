os
==

A very simple, free and open source operating system.

This operating system included the source code for both the bootloader, which currenly only works
for a 1.44MB floppy disk, and the kernel.

A few features that have been implemented so far:
1) a working bootloader
2) switching the cpu from real mode to protected mode
3) simple string printing functions

This project is still in its VERY early stages, and I am currenly the only one working on it, so progress
will be pretty slow.
